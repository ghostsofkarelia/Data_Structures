# Data_Structures
Some JavaScript based data structure stuff I wrote. I'll continue to add stuff to it partially to archive it for use later and also to consolidate all
the code I've written.

##Simple Sorting Algorithms

I got insertion, bubble and selection sort in there 

##Complex sorting Algorithms

Merge sort and Quick sort. Best examples of divide and conquer using recursion

##Linked Lists

Implemented Stacks and Queues using Linked List

##Arrays

Implemented Stacks and Queues using arrays

##Depth First Search

Couldn't find a proper recursive implementation of DFS so wrote one of my own

##Dynamic Programming

Some common dynamic programming problems like Kadane's, Longest Common Subsequence, Towers of Hanoi and Maximal subarray
